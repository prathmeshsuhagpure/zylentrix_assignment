## Getting Started

## What This App Does

1. Fetches post data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
2. Shows a loading spinner while data is being fetched
3. Displays all posts in a scrollable list
4. Lets you tap on a post to see its full details
5. Shows helpful error messages if something goes wrong
6. Includes pull-to-refresh to reload the posts

## Extra Stuff I Added

1. Detail screen for viewing the full content of posts
2. Pull-to-refresh functionality for a better user experience
3. "Try Again" button if the API request fails
4. Card-based design that looks good on different screen sizes
5. Clean folder structure that separates models, screens, and services

## Tech Used
